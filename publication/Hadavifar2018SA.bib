abstract ={Aims: Nowadays, dangerous chemical pollutants by a numerous of natural and synthetic sources are produced and released to the environment. These pollutants have short-term and long-term effects on human health. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of climate parameters and instability indices on air pollution in Tehran-Iran.  Materials and Methods: To evaluate the impact of meteorological parameters and indices of stability and instability on sensitivity analysis in Tehran-Iran, the Sharif University monitoring station was selected for air sampling and analysis. Sampling was performed from March 2011 to July 2012 in Tehran.  Findings: Results of sensitivity analysis showed that average daily change of the concentration of pollutants throughout the year was very different and intensively influenced by meteorological parameters. Results showed that wind direction (WD) (82%) and relative humidity (32%) and temperature (20%) have the most influence on the concentration values of pollutants carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10), and air quality index (AQI). The highest concentrations of CO occurred in summer and lowest in winter, and maximum concentration of PM10 was in autumn, and its lowest concentration was in spring. Results revealed that the lowest average of AQI occurred in the spring, while in autumn, winter, and summer have almost equal values, but in winter AQI has slightly higher values.  Conclusion: According to the results of this research in Sharif station Tehran, the WD has the highest impact percentage (82%) on the concentration of pollutants. The highest concentrations of CO occurred in summer, and maximum concentration of PM10 was in autumn. },
